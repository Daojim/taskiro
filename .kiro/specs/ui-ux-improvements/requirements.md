2. WHEN actions are processing THEN buttons SHALL show loading states to prevent double-clicks
3. WHEN operations complete THEN success feedback SHALL be provided through notifications
4. WHEN errors occur THEN clear, actionable error messages SHALL be displayed
5. WHEN network requests are slow THEN skeleton loading states SHALL be shown
6. WHEN pull-to-refresh is triggered THEN a clear refresh indicator SHALL be visible

### Requirement 7: Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation
