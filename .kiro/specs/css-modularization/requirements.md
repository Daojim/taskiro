# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current CSS architecture has grown organically and now suffers from several critical issues: a massive 3000+ line emergency-styles.css file that overrides everything, multiple overlapping CSS files with duplicate styles, unclear import hierarchy, and difficulty in maintaining and debugging styles. This feature will restructure the CSS architecture into a clean, modular system where each CSS file has a clear purpose and scope, eliminating redundancy and improving maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear CSS architecture with modular files, so that I can easily understand, maintain, and debug styles without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine the CSS file structure THEN I SHALL see clearly named, purpose-specific CSS files organized in logical directories
2. WHEN I look at any CSS file THEN I SHALL understand its specific scope and purpose from its name and location
3. WHEN I need to modify styles for a specific component THEN I SHALL know exactly which file contains those styles
4. WHEN I add new styles THEN I SHALL have clear guidelines on where to place them

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate CSS duplication and conflicts, so that styles are predictable and don't override each other unexpectedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine the codebase THEN I SHALL find no duplicate CSS rules across different files
2. WHEN I apply a style class THEN I SHALL get predictable results without unexpected overrides
3. WHEN I remove the emergency-styles.css file THEN I SHALL see no visual regressions in the application
4. WHEN I inspect CSS specificity THEN I SHALL see a logical hierarchy without !important overrides

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want component-specific CSS files, so that styles are co-located with their components and easy to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine a React component THEN I SHALL see its styles either in a co-located CSS file or clearly imported from a shared module
2. WHEN I modify a component THEN I SHALL be able to find and edit its styles without searching through multiple files
3. WHEN I delete a component THEN I SHALL be able to easily identify and remove its associated styles
4. WHEN I create a new component THEN I SHALL have clear patterns to follow for styling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear CSS import hierarchy, so that I understand the order of style application and can debug conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine the main CSS entry points THEN I SHALL see a clear, documented import order
2. WHEN I trace a style issue THEN I SHALL be able to follow the import chain to find the source
3. WHEN I add new CSS imports THEN I SHALL know where they belong in the hierarchy
4. WHEN I build the application THEN I SHALL see consistent CSS output regardless of build environment

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shared utility and design system styles, so that I can maintain consistency across components without duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need common utilities (spacing, colors, typography) THEN I SHALL import them from a centralized utilities file
2. WHEN I need design system components (buttons, cards, forms) THEN I SHALL import them from a design system module
3. WHEN I update a design token THEN I SHALL see the change reflected across all components that use it
4. WHEN I examine utility classes THEN I SHALL see they follow a consistent naming convention

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want responsive and theme-specific styles organized separately, so that I can maintain them independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to modify responsive breakpoints THEN I SHALL find them in a dedicated responsive styles file
2. WHEN I need to update dark mode styles THEN I SHALL find them organized in a theme-specific section or file
3. WHEN I add new responsive behavior THEN I SHALL have clear patterns to follow
4. WHEN I test different themes THEN I SHALL see consistent styling without conflicts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance-optimized CSS loading, so that the application loads quickly and only loads necessary styles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN I SHALL see critical styles loaded first and non-critical styles loaded asynchronously where possible
2. WHEN I examine the CSS bundle THEN I SHALL see no unused styles included in the production build
3. WHEN I measure CSS file sizes THEN I SHALL see they are optimized and not excessively large
4. WHEN I analyze loading performance THEN I SHALL see improved metrics compared to the current emergency-styles approach
