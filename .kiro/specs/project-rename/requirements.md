# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for systematically renaming the Taskiro project to Taskoro across all files, configurations, documentation, and infrastructure components. The rename must be comprehensive to ensure no broken references remain while maintaining full functionality of the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all project references updated from "Taskiro" to "Taskoro", so that the project has a consistent new identity across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the rename is complete THEN all occurrences of "Taskiro" in documentation SHALL be replaced with "Taskoro"
2. WHEN the rename is complete THEN all occurrences of "taskiro" in file names, folder names, and configurations SHALL be replaced with "taskoro"
3. WHEN the rename is complete THEN the application SHALL function identically to before the rename
4. WHEN the rename is complete THEN all URLs, paths, and references SHALL point to the correct renamed locations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the package configuration updated, so that the project builds and runs with the new name.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package.json is updated THEN the "name" field SHALL be "taskoro"
2. WHEN Docker configurations are updated THEN container names and image tags SHALL use "taskoro"
3. WHEN npm scripts are updated THEN any script references to "taskiro" SHALL be updated to "taskoro"
4. WHEN the project is built THEN all generated artifacts SHALL use the new "taskoro" naming

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database configurations updated, so that the application connects to properly named database resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment files are updated THEN database URLs SHALL reference "taskoro_db" instead of "taskiro_db"
2. WHEN environment files are updated THEN database usernames SHALL reference "taskoro" instead of "taskiro"
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL successfully connect to the renamed database resources
4. WHEN database migrations run THEN they SHALL work with the new database naming scheme

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all documentation updated, so that setup instructions and project information reflect the new name.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN README files are updated THEN all references to "Taskiro" SHALL be "Taskoro"
2. WHEN documentation is updated THEN all file paths referencing "taskiro" SHALL be updated to "taskoro"
3. WHEN setup instructions are updated THEN commands referencing the old folder name SHALL be corrected
4. WHEN the documentation is reviewed THEN it SHALL provide accurate setup and usage instructions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project folder structure updated, so that the main directory reflects the new project name.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the folder rename is complete THEN the main project folder SHALL be named "taskoro"
2. WHEN folder references are updated THEN all documentation SHALL reference the correct "taskoro" folder
3. WHEN the project is accessed THEN all relative paths SHALL work correctly with the new folder structure
4. WHEN development commands are run THEN they SHALL execute from the correct "taskoro" directory

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want spec files and configuration updated, so that existing project specifications remain accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN spec files are updated THEN all references to "Taskiro" SHALL be changed to "Taskoro"
2. WHEN VS Code settings are updated THEN spell check dictionaries SHALL include "Taskoro" instead of "Taskiro"
3. WHEN existing specs are updated THEN they SHALL accurately describe the renamed project
4. WHEN new development occurs THEN it SHALL reference the correct project name throughout

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all generated files and artifacts updated, so that build outputs and reports use the new project name.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN coverage reports are regenerated THEN they SHALL reference "taskoro" paths instead of "taskiro"
2. WHEN Docker images are built THEN they SHALL be tagged with "taskoro" instead of "taskiro"
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN all deployment artifacts SHALL use the new naming
4. WHEN logs are generated THEN they SHALL reference the correct project name and paths
