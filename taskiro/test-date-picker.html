    <h1>Native Date Picker Test</h1>
    <p>
      This is a minimal test to see if native date pickers work in this
      environment:
    </p>

    <input
      type="date"
      value="2025-08-05"
      style="font-size: 14px; padding: 8px"
    />

    <p>
      If the calendar button doesn't work here, it's a system/browser
      configuration issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it works here but not in the app, it's a CSS/JavaScript interference
      issue.
