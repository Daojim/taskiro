# Theme Persistence Implementation - COMPLETE âœ…

## Task 7: Implement theme persistence

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

### What Was Implemented:

1. **âœ… Store user's theme preference in localStorage**
   - Theme is saved to `localStorage` with key `taskiro_theme`
   - Automatically saved whenever theme changes via `toggleTheme()` or `setTheme()`

2. **âœ… Restore saved theme preference on page load/refresh**
   - Pre-React script in `index.html` applies theme immediately on page load
   - ThemeContext initializes with saved theme from localStorage
   - Falls back to system preference if no saved theme exists

3. **âœ… Prevent theme from reverting to light mode on page refresh**
   - Theme is applied in `<head>` before React loads to prevent flash
   - Theme state is persisted and restored consistently
   - No more reverting to light mode on refresh

### ðŸ”§ Key Implementation Changes:

#### 1. Pre-React Theme Script (`index.html`)

Added a script in the HTML head that runs before React loads:

```javascript
// Applies saved theme immediately to prevent flash
const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('taskiro_theme');
if (savedTheme === 'dark') {
  document.documentElement.classList.add('dark');
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced ThemeContext (`src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`)

- Reads from localStorage on initialization
- Applies theme to document root (`<html>` element)
- Saves theme changes to localStorage automatically
- Handles system preference fallback

#### 3. CSS Theme Support (`src/styles/core/themes.css` & `variables.css`)

- Complete dark mode CSS variables
- Smooth transitions between themes
- Proper contrast and accessibility

### ðŸ§ª Testing Instructions:

1. **Basic Test**:
   - Toggle to dark mode using the theme toggle button
   - Refresh the page
   - âœ… Theme should remain dark (no flash to light)

2. **localStorage Verification**:

   ```javascript
   // Check in browser console
   localStorage.getItem('taskiro_theme'); // Should show 'dark' or 'light'
   ```

3. **System Preference Test**:
   - Clear localStorage: `localStorage.removeItem('taskiro_theme')`
   - Refresh page - should use system preference
   - Set preference again - should save and persist

### ðŸ“‹ Files Modified:

- `index.html` - Added pre-React theme script
- `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` - Enhanced theme persistence
- `taskiro/debug-theme.html` - Debug tool for testing (optional)

### ðŸŽ¯ Requirements Satisfied:

- **Requirement 8.6**: Theme persistence across page refreshes âœ…
- No more theme reverting to light mode âœ…
- Smooth user experience with no flash âœ…

The theme persistence is now fully functional and production-ready!

## ðŸ”§ Flash Prevention Fix

**Issue**: White flash during page refresh in dark mode
**Solution**: Added inline CSS in `index.html` head section

### What Was Added:

- Inline CSS that sets immediate background colors
- Proper dark mode styles for `html`, `body`, and `#root`
- No dependency on external CSS loading

### Result:

- âœ… No more white flash during page refresh
- âœ… Smooth theme transitions
- âœ… Instant theme application before React loads

The theme persistence is now completely seamless!
