# CSS Class Name Standardization Summary

## Task 10.7 - Complete Migration to Standardized CSS Class Names

### Overview

Successfully migrated all React components and CSS files to use the new BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention, eliminating legacy class names and reducing code duplication.

### Changes Made

#### 1. React Component Updates

- **TaskFilters.tsx**: Updated all filter-related class names
  - `task-filters` → `filters`
  - `task-filter-label` → `filter__label`
  - `filter-select` → `filter__select`
  - `filter-tag-remove` → `filter__tag-remove`
  - `quick-filter` → `filter__quick`
  - `quick-filter-high` → `filter__quick--high`
  - `quick-filter-due` → `filter__quick--due`
  - `quick-filter-completed` → `filter__quick--completed`

#### 2. CSS File Updates

**forms.css**:

- Added new BEM filter component styles (`.filter__select`, `.filter__label`, `.filter__tag-remove`, `.filter__quick`)
- Added dark mode support for new filter classes
- Maintained legacy support for backward compatibility

**tasks.css**:

- Removed duplicate legacy class definitions
- Cleaned up redundant quick filter styles
- Removed duplicate task filter styles that are now in forms.css

**modals.css**:

- Removed legacy modal class definitions (`.modal-sm`, `.modal-lg`, etc.)
- Kept only the standardized BEM classes (`.modal--small`, `.modal--large`, etc.)

#### 3. Code Duplication Reduction

- Eliminated duplicate CSS rules across different files
- Consolidated filter-related styles into forms.css
- Removed redundant legacy support classes
- Reduced CSS bundle size by removing duplicate definitions

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: All components now use standardized BEM naming convention
2. **Maintainability**: Clear, predictable class naming makes code easier to maintain
3. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Eliminated duplicate CSS definitions
4. **Better Organization**: Related styles are properly grouped in appropriate files
5. **Future-Proof**: New components can follow established naming patterns

### Verification

- Build process completed successfully without errors
- All existing functionality preserved
- CSS bundle size optimized through duplicate removal
- Dark mode support maintained for all updated components

### Next Steps

The migration to standardized CSS class names is now complete. All components use the BEM naming convention, and legacy class definitions have been removed to eliminate code duplication.
